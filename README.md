# API-Santiago

This is my project I made with Santiago. I followed along in the lecture and learned a lot along the way.

### What we learned

- Postman, how to use it and why it is used
- Error codes - Santiago uses 200 for OK, 400 for front end problems (such as 404) and 500 for backend problems.
- How the backend works, node.js and php 
- How the URL is built up
- How Rest API has GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH
- How normal API only uses GET and POST
- POST is for personal info like logging in or filling out forms, GET is for other stuff like searching.
- PUT is rarely used and if you update data with that, you have to put in ALL the data, not just what you are changing, if you do that all the other data disappears.
- PATCH is used to update data.
